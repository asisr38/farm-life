# Leasing and Operating an Organic Farm in Kathmandu Valley – 2025 Guide

## 1. Executive Summary
Leasing farmland on the rim of Kathmandu Valley is the most capital‑efficient way to test full‑time organic farming while keeping the door open to future ownership. A well‑structured 5 + 5‑year lease, combined with clear clauses for profit‑sharing or a purchase option, lets you secure land, build soil, and develop markets before committing tens of millions of rupees to a permanent purchase.

- **Young farmers (< 35 yrs) make up ~11 %** of operators; most youth migrate abroad for study or work, leaving land fallow.  
- Over twenty years, cropland inside the Ring Road has dropped by **20–25 %**, replaced by urban sprawl.  
- Demand for chemical‑free vegetables is booming, with city consumers paying **20–50 %** price premiums for certified organic produce.

## 3. Why Lease First
| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Capital‑light** | Typical lease: NPR 1.1–1.3 lakh per ropani / year vs. purchase prices of 15–45 lakh per ropani. |
| **Legal ceilings** | Individuals are capped at 25 ropani inside the Valley; leasing avoids complex ownership limits. |
| **Flexibility** | Exit after 5 years if lifestyle or markets don’t meet expectations, without a sunk investment in land. |
| **Negotiating power** | Idle plots and labour shortages make landowners more open to creative lease‑to‑own or profit‑share deals. |

## 4. Ownership & Earnings Structures

| Model | How It Works | Best For | Key Cautions |
|-------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Straight Cash Lease** | Fixed rent; you keep all crop income. | Predictable, high‑value crops. | Negotiate a 5‑year renewal option. |
| **Share Lease (Bataiya)** | Split (usually 50 : 50) of net harvest. | Low upfront capital, shared risk. | Define who pays which inputs. |
| **Lease‑with‑Option** | Part of rent accrues as down‑payment; pre‑agreed strike price. | Serious about buying but want proof first. | Clarify who pays any capital‑gains tax. |
| **Joint‑Venture Company** | Landowner contributes land as equity; you add cash & labour. | Agro‑tourism, processing ventures. | Establish board governance & exit terms. |
| **Co‑operative / CSA Partnership** | Several lessees pool land and brand. | Scaling a Valley‑wide organic box. | Annual audits and shared decision making. |

## 6. Living & Working On‑Farm: Practical Setup

|------|------------------|--------------|
| Housing | Convert a 40 m² cowshed into an earth‑bag cottage (1‑bed). | 9–10 lakh |
